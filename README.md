# 🚧 Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard that analyzes and visualizes road accident data in United Kingdom (UK) using an Excel dataset. The dashboard provides meaningful insights such as accident trends over time, state-wise analysis, time-of-day impacts, and severity levels — aiding understanding of accident patterns and supporting decision-making for safety improvements.
This dashboard is designed to analyze road accident data with a primary focus on casualty metrics. It provides both high-level and granular insights into the total number of casualties, severity, vehicle types involved, and road-related factors.

🎯 Primary KPIs
✅ Total Casualties occurred after road accidents

✅ Total Casualties & % breakdown by accident severity

✅ Maximum casualties by vehicle type

📈 Secondary KPIs
🚗 Casualty distribution by vehicle type

📆 Monthly trend comparison between the current and previous year

🛣️ Maximum casualties by road type

🌧️ Casualty distribution by road surface condition

🗺️ Casualty breakdown by area/location and day/night

These KPIs help in identifying high-risk zones, severe accident types, and environmental factors influencing accident impact.
